# nucleotideEnergeticsVisualizer


This project is meant to showcase the energetic characteristics of natural oligonucleotides.


1.) Users can input a geneID, or list of geneIDs, which will be sent to the pullReferences module.

2.) pullReferences will communicate with the NCBI servers to inforation on the gene(s) including sequence.

3.) The nucleotideEnergeticsVisualizer will plot physical values along the length of the gene transcript.
